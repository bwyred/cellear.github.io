Greetings!  I am a seasoned web team manager and technology consultant with 18 years of experience directly managing engineers, graphic artists, and content creators. I am relentlessly customer-focused and passionate about delivering the best possible user experience.  Websites are not just a job for me -- I care deeply about helping my users get the most out of whatever they’re trying to do.
